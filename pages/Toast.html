    <h2>How to Make French Toast</h2>
    <p>

      comfort of your own kitchen – you just need a skillet, a few staple
      ingredients, and a good recipe. That's where we come in!

    <h3>Best Bread For French Toast</h3>
    <p>
      The best breads for French toast are brioche, sourdough, French bread, or
      challah. These varieties are dense and sturdy enough to handle total
      saturation in the wet, milky, egg custard without falling apart. However,
      in a pinch, any thick-sliced white bread will do. French toast is
      traditionally made with day-old slices because they absorb the eggy
      mixture better than fresh ones (and this method prevents waste – it's a
      win-win). Of course, a slightly stale loaf is certainly not a requirement.
      If you only have fresh bread on hand, that'll work just fine.

    <h3>French Toast Ingredients</h3>

      variations contain the following ingredients:

    <ul>
      <li>
        White Bread: Thick-cut bread is the base for all French toast. Sturdy,
        dense, slightly stale slices absorb the custard-like egg mixture better
